## Various Random LaTeX templates


  * `Cut_A0_poster_to_16_A4.tex` and `Cut_A0_poster_to_4_A3.tex` are taken from [this thread on stackoverflow](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/171500/how-to-print-a0-poster-as-an-array-of-combinable-a4-pages), all credit goes to the incredibly awesome [Malipivo](http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/48028/malipivo). To use, name your input A0 file as `input-A0.pdf` and compile the relevant (A3 or A4) tex file. If you cut it to A3, the resulting format is A1, once combined (but it's less cutting and less frustration when hanging. It worth it, trust me).
  * `PLAN_2cols_travel_example.tex` and `PLAN_multidays_freeroam.tex` are my templates for daily plans, in two possible formats.
